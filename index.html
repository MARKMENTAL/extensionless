                <p class="lead">Welcome to the extensionless framework! This is a minimalistic web framework written in C, that enables file-based routing for HTML, CSS, and image files without requiring file extensions. It is designed to quickly put together web apps and simple company websites where URLs without file extensions are preferred.</p>
                <p class="lead">With extensionless, you can create and serve web pages with clean and professional-looking URLs, such as /about or /contact. You don't need to install any additional libraries or dependencies, just run your C web server and you're good to go. You can also easily link between your pages and assets using simple relative paths.</p>
                <p class="lead">Extensionless is ideal for small-scale projects and static sites where simplicity and ease-of-use are valued. It's also a great learning tool for beginners who want to understand the basics of web development and how web servers, request handling, and routing work.</p>
