                <p class="lead">Gentoo Linux was founded by Daniel Robbins in 2000, with a vision to create a flexible, customizable Linux distribution that puts control in the hands of the user.</p>
                <p class="lead">Guided by the philosophy of choice and flexibility, Gentoo allows users to build their systems from the ground up, selecting only the components they need and optimizing them for their specific hardware. This approach ensures that each Gentoo system is unique, tailored to the individual's preferences and requirements.</p>
                <p class="lead">The Gentoo community is vibrant and active, with contributors and enthusiasts from around the world. Collaboration, innovation, and support define the community, making it a welcoming place for both newcomers and experienced users.</p>
