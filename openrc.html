                <p class="lead">OpenRC is a dependency-based init system used by Gentoo Linux. It maintains the system initialization and manages services through runlevels. OpenRC is designed to be simple, efficient, and flexible, providing robust control over the startup and management of services.</p>
                <p class="lead">One of the key features of OpenRC is its modular design, allowing for easy customization and extension. It supports parallel service startup and integrates seamlessly with the Gentoo system, taking full advantage of the distribution's philosophy of choice and control.</p>
                <p class="lead">Whether you are managing a single desktop or a complex server environment, OpenRC provides the tools you need to configure, control, and monitor your services, all while maintaining the speed and reliability that Gentoo users have come to expect.</p>
